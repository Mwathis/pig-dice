# Pig Dice

## Author
Charles Mwathi

## Description
This is a game where two users can play against each other,such that each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
